# Repo Readiness Checklist

**Purpose:** To quickly verify that the repository meets the high standards required for the OpenAI EMEA Youth & Wellbeing Grant review.

## 1. Governance & Ethics
- [ ] **Safeguarding Policy:** `SAFEGUARDING.md` is present, role-specific, and operational.
- [ ] **Data Protection:** `DATA_PROTECTION.md` covers GDPR, minimization, and breach response.
- [ ] **Ethical Framework:** `ETHICS_REVIEW.md` outlines participant protection and bias checks.
- [ ] **Code of Conduct:** `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` is standard and includes a reporting contact.
- [ ] **License:** `LICENSE.md` clearly distinguishes between Content (CC-BY) and Code (MIT/Apache).

## 2. Grant Alignment
- [ ] **Grant Map:** `docs/GRANT_ALIGNMENT.md` explicitly links repo artifacts to grant themes.
- [ ] **Theory of Change:** `docs/THEORY_OF_CHANGE.md` shows a clear logic model (Problem -> Impact).
- [ ] **Impact Plan:** `docs/IMPACT_MEASUREMENT_PLAN.md` defines measurable metrics beyond vanity numbers.
- [ ] **Evaluation:** `docs/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md` details a rigorous study design (Pre/Post).

## 3. Project Clarity
- [ ] **README Summary:** `README.md` has a clear, one-sentence value proposition.
- [ ] **Target Audience:** Defined in `README.md` (Youth, Educators, Policymakers).
- [ ] **Deliverables:** `docs/DELIVERABLES_ROADMAP.md` lists concrete outputs with timelines.
- [ ] **Stakeholder Outputs:** `docs/STAKEHOLDER_OUTPUTS.md` describes practical tools (Briefs, Guides).

## 4. Operational Readiness
- [ ] **Timeline:** Roadmap covers the grant period (12-24 months) with milestones.
- [ ] **Team:** Roles (Safeguarding Lead, Tech Lead) are identified (even if names are TODO).
- [ ] **Contribution:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` explains how others can join.
- [ ] **Security:** `SECURITY.md` provides a vulnerability reporting path.

## 5. Quality Assurance
- [ ] **No Hype:** Language is professional, evidence-based, and avoids "AI magic" claims.
- [ ] **No Dead Ends:** All "TODO" items are clearly marked and not disguised as finished work.
- [ ] **Consistency:** Terminology (e.g., "Youth", "Participant") is consistent across files.
- [ ] **Links:** Internal links between documents work.
