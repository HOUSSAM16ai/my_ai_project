# Ethics, Safeguarding & Data Protection (Draft)

> **Operational Safeguards**: Strict compliance with GDPR/COPPA.

**Consent & Safeguarding**
We adhere to strict child protection protocols. All participation requires written parental/guardian consent and verbal assent from youth. Sessions operate under a "Two-Adult Rule" (minimum two vetted facilitators present) to ensure safety. Our Risk Register (see `SAFEGUARDING.md`) details mitigation strategies for potential exposure to harmful content, including real-time moderation and immediate psychosocial support ("cool-down" protocols) if distress occurs.

**Data Collection & Protection**
We prioritize "Privacy by Design." No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected from minors; participants use random IDs. Data collected includes anonymized audit logs (prompts/responses) and aggregate demographic ranges. All data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit. Raw datasets are accessible only to the Principal Investigator and Data Steward. We commit to open-access publishing of aggregated findings but will never release raw data that could re-identify a vulnerable user.
