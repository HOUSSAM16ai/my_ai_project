# License Recommendation & Guide

This repository contains both documentation/educational content and software code. We recommend a dual-licensing approach to maximize utility and openness.

## Recommended Licenses

### 1. For Documentation & Creative Content (e.g., /docs, PDFs, Toolkits)
**Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)**
- **Why:** Allows others to freely share and adapt the materials (even commercially) as long as they give appropriate credit. Ideally suited for educational resources and research outputs.
- **Grant Alignment:** Encourages broad dissemination and impact.

### 2. For Software Code (e.g., /app, scripts, tools)
**MIT License** or **Apache License 2.0**
- **Why:** Permissive open-source licenses.
  - **MIT:** Short, simple, very permissive.
  - **Apache 2.0:** Similar to MIT but includes an express patent grant (good for AI/safety tools).
- **Grant Alignment:** Ensures the technical tools are "public goods" and can be widely adopted.

## Decision Guide for Project Lead

1.  **Review:** Does your organization have a specific IP policy? If yes, follow that.
2.  **Choose:**
    - If you want simplicity -> MIT for code.
    - If you want patent protection -> Apache 2.0 for code.
    - Always use CC-BY 4.0 for the written toolkit content.
3.  **Action:**
    - [ ] Select the final licenses.
    - [ ] Copy the full license text into this file (replacing this guide) or create separate `LICENSE-DOCS` and `LICENSE-CODE` files.
    - [ ] Update the root `README.md` to mention the license choice.
