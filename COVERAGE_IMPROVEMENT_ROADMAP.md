## 🛠️ Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Testing Best Practices
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Mock external dependencies (LLM APIs, databases)
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use parametrized tests for multiple scenarios

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test service interactions
- Test API endpoints end-to-end
- Test database transactions
- Test authentication/authorization flows

### 3. Mocking Strategy
```python
# Example: Mock LLM API calls
@patch('app.services.llm_client_service.OpenAI')
def test_generate_text(mock_openai):
    mock_openai.return_value.chat.completions.create.return_value = Mock(
        choices=[Mock(message=Mock(content="Generated text"))]
    )
    result = service.generate("prompt")
    assert result == "Generated text"
```

### 4. Coverage Tools
- Use `pytest-cov` for coverage measurement
- Generate HTML reports: `pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html`
- Use `coverage.py` for detailed analysis
- Set up pre-commit hooks to prevent coverage regression

## 📝 Notes

- Focus on quality over quantity - well-written tests are more valuable than high coverage numbers
- Mock external dependencies to keep tests fast and reliable
- Document complex test scenarios
- Use coverage as a guide, not a goal - some code may not need 100% coverage
- Prioritize testing critical business logic and user-facing features
