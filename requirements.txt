# requirements.txt - The Strict Compatibility & Optimized Resource Protocol (vFinal)

# --- [RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION & COMPATIBILITY PROTOCOL] ---
# 1. We tell pip to find CPU-specific torch packages first.
--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# 2. We pin specific, known-to-be-compatible versions to prevent dependency conflicts.
#    This is the key to solving the 'NoneType' error in SentenceTransformer.
