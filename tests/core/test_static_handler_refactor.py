    # Case 1: Attempt to access a file outside via traversal
    # Note: Modern clients/frameworks normalize paths before they hit the app logic.
    # If the client normalizes "/../etc/passwd" to "/etc/passwd", the handler will receive "/etc/passwd".
    # The handler constructs potential_path = static_dir + "/etc/passwd".
    # This path does not exist inside static_dir, so it should be treated as an SPA route or 404.

    # If we want to test RAW traversal (where ".." actually reaches the handler),
    # we would need to manually invoke the handler or use a raw socket, which is complex here.
    # Instead, we verify that accessing a "suspicious" path behaves as expected (returns 404 or index.html, NOT the sensitive file).

    # Try to access a known system file (mocked by expectation)
    response = client.get("/../etc/passwd")

    # Depending on client normalization:
    # 1. Normalized to "/etc/passwd" -> Handler looks for STATIC/etc/passwd -> Not found -> SPA Fallback (200 Index) OR 404 if "etc" looks like api?
    # 2. Raw "/../etc/passwd" -> Handler detects traversal -> 404.

    # In this app, SPA fallback serves index.html for unknown routes.
    # So getting 200 (Index) is actually SAFE (we didn't leak /etc/passwd).
    # Getting 404 is also SAFE.
    # Getting the CONTENT of /etc/passwd would be UNSAFE.

        assert response.text == "<html>Index</html>"
        # Confirms we served the fallback, not the sensitive file.
