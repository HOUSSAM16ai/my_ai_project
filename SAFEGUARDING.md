# Safeguarding Policy

**Purpose:** To ensure the safety and wellbeing of all youth participants, partners, and team members involved in the Youth AI Safety Toolkit project.

## 1. Roles & Responsibilities

### Safeguarding Lead (DSL)

- **Responsibilities:**

### Team Members
- Must read and sign this policy.
- Must complete basic safeguarding training (e.g., NSPCC or local equivalent).
- Must report any concerns immediately to the DSL.

## 2. Consent & Assent Process

We adhere to a "valid, informed, and continuous" consent model.

- **Minors (<18):**
  - **Parental/Guardian Consent:** Required for all direct participation (interviews, workshops, testing).
  - **Youth Assent:** Explaining the activity in age-appropriate language and obtaining the young person's affirmative agreement.
  - **Right to Withdraw:** Participants can stop at any time without penalty.
- **Young Adults (18+):**
  - Informed consent required.

**Documentation:**
- See `templates/CONSENT_FORM_PARENTS.md` [TODO: Create template]
- See `templates/ASSENT_FORM_YOUTH.md` [TODO: Create template]

## 3. Harm Prevention & Incident Response

### Prevention
- **Two-Adult Rule:** No team member should be alone with a minor in a private setting (online or offline).
- **Vetted Platforms:** Use only approved, moderated platforms for digital interactions.
- **Content Safety:** All AI outputs generated during testing must be screened for age-appropriateness.

### Incident Response Protocol
1. **Immediate Action:** Ensure the immediate safety of the child. Call emergency services if there is immediate danger.
2. **Report:** Log the incident internally within 2 hours using the Incident Report Form.
3. **Escalate:** Notify the Safeguarding Lead immediately.
4. **Review:** The Safeguarding Lead assesses the severity and determines next steps (e.g., contacting parents, notifying authorities, internal discipline).

## 4. Red Flags & Mandatory Reporting

While we are not a statutory body, we have a moral and often legal duty to report concerns.

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Disclosure of abuse or neglect.
- Signs of physical injury or severe distress.
- Inappropriate sexual behavior or knowledge.
- Online grooming indicators.

**Reporting Mechanism:**
- If a disclosure is made, listen without judgment, do not promise confidentiality, and explain you must tell someone who can help.
- **Legal Context:** [TODO: Insert local mandatory reporting laws summary]

## 5. Partner Site Requirements Checklist

Before deploying the toolkit with a partner organization (school, youth club), verify:

- [ ] Partner has their own Safeguarding Policy.
- [ ] Partner has a Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) on site.
- [ ] Safe recruitment checks (background checks) are in place for their staff.
- [ ] Physical/Digital space is safe and supervised.
