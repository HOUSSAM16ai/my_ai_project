## 1. Roles and Responsibilities

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Safeguarding Lead** | Oversees all child protection protocols, vets staff, and manages high-level risks. | TODO: Name & Email |
| **Incident Lead** | First point of contact for any safety incidents during sessions. Triages and escalates. | TODO: Name & Email |

## 2. Consent and Assent Flow

1.  **Parental/Guardian Consent**:
    -   Must be obtained in writing (digital or physical) **before** any session.
    -   Must clearly explain the nature of AI safety testing (potential exposure to harmful text/images, though moderated).
    -   Must explain data usage and privacy.
    -   **Opt-out**: Parents can withdraw consent at any time without penalty.

2.  **Youth Assent**:
    -   Participants (minors) must be informed in age-appropriate language.
    -   They must verbally agree or sign a simplified assent form.
    -   They are reminded they can stop or take a break at any time ("Right to Withdraw").

## 3. Risk Assessment Checklist (Pre-Session)

-   [ ] **Venue/Platform**: Is the physical space safe? Is the digital platform secure and private?
-   [ ] **Staffing**: Are there at least two vetted adults present for every session (**Two-Adult Rule**)?
-   [ ] **Content**: Has the AI test dataset been pre-screened to remove illegal or strictly prohibited content (CSAM, extreme violence)?
-   [ ] **Support**: Is there a designated "quiet space" or counselor available if a participant becomes distressed?
-   [ ] **Emergency**: Do we have emergency contact details for all participants?

## 4. Incident Response Playbook

**Triage → Escalation → Documentation → Aftercare**

1.  **Triage**:
    -   **Stop**: If a participant is distressed or an unsafe situation arises, stop the activity immediately.
    -   **Assess**: Is this a safeguarding emergency (immediate harm) or a wellbeing concern (distress)?

2.  **Escalation**:
    -   **Emergency**: Call local emergency services if there is immediate danger.
    -   **Report**: Notify the **Incident Lead** immediately.

3.  **Documentation**:
    -   Complete an Incident Report Form within 24 hours.
    -   Log facts only (who, what, where, when). Avoid speculation.

4.  **Aftercare**:
    -   Follow up with the participant and parent/guardian.
    -   Debrief with staff to prevent recurrence.
