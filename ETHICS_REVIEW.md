# Ethics Review & Principles

**Purpose:** To outline the ethical framework governing the Youth AI Safety Toolkit, ensuring all activities respect human dignity, autonomy, and justice.

## 1. Core Ethical Principles

We align with the **Menlo Report** and **Belmont Report** principles adapted for AI/Tech:

1. **Respect for Persons:** Treating individuals as autonomous agents and protecting those with diminished autonomy (youth).
2. **Beneficence:** Maximizing benefits and minimizing harms (do no harm).
3. **Justice:** Ensuring fair distribution of benefits and burdens; avoiding exploitation of vulnerable groups.
4. **Respect for Law & Public Interest:** Operating transparently and legally.

## 2. Participant Protection

- **Vulnerability:** We recognize youth as a vulnerable population requiring extra safeguards (see `SAFEGUARDING.md`).
- **Voluntary Participation:** No coercion. Incentives (if any) must not be undue or manipulative.
- **Debriefing:** Participants in user testing or research must be debriefed about the study's purpose and nature.

## 3. Avoiding Manipulative or Harmful Content

In developing AI safety tools:
- **No Dark Patterns:** We will not use design interfaces that trick or manipulate users.
- **Content Safety:** We do not generate or expose youth to CSAM, hate speech, self-harm content, or extreme violence during testing.
- **AI Literacy:** We aim to demystify AI, not anthropomorphize it deceptively.

## 4. Bias & Fairness

- **Algorithmic Bias:** We actively test our tools for performance disparities across gender, race, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
- **Inclusive Design:** We co-design with a diverse range of youth, including neurodivergent youth and those from marginalized communities.
- **Language:** Tools should be accessible and culturally appropriate for the EMEA region (considering multiple languages where feasible).

## 5. Research Integrity & Independence

- **Honesty:** We report findings accurately, including failures and null results.
- **Independence:** Our research is independent of commercial interests. Funding sources are transparently declared.
- **Reproducibility:** We share methods and (anonymized) data to allow others to verify and build on our work.

## 6. Review Workflow

All major project phases undergo an internal ethics review:

1.  **Proposal:** Team submits a brief describing the activity, participants, and potential risks.
2.  **Review:** The Ethics Lead (and external advisors if high risk) reviews against this framework.
3.  **Approval/Modification:** Activity is approved, rejected, or sent back for modification (e.g., "Add more safeguards").
4.  **Monitoring:** Ongoing check-ins during the activity.
