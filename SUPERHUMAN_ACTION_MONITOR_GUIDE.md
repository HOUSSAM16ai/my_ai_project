python scripts/check_action_health.py

# View latest health report
cat .github/health-reports/latest-health.md
```

---

## 🏗️ Components

### 1. Workflow Monitor (`.github/workflows/superhuman-action-monitor.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- ✅ On workflow completion (any workflow)
- ✅ On scheduled intervals (every 6 hours)
- ✅ Manual dispatch

**Jobs:**
- `monitor-and-analyze`: Detects and diagnoses failures
- `auto-fix`: Applies automatic fixes
- `health-dashboard`: Generates health reports
- `notify`: Sends notifications

### 2. Health Checker Script (`scripts/check_action_health.py`)

Comprehensive Python script that:
- ✅ Validates workflow files
- ✅ Checks formatting tools
- ✅ Analyzes code quality
- ✅ Generates fix scripts
- ✅ Creates detailed reports

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run full health check
python scripts/check_action_health.py

# Check specific aspects
python scripts/check_action_health.py --check workflows
python scripts/check_action_health.py --check formatting
python scripts/check_action_health.py --check quality
```

### 3. Auto-Fix Script (`scripts/auto_fix_quality.sh`)

Auto-generated script for fixing detected issues:

```bash
# Apply all fixes
./scripts/auto_fix_quality.sh

# Or manually fix specific issues:
black --line-length=100 app/ tests/
isort --profile=black --line-length=100 app/ tests/
ruff check --fix app/ tests/
```

---

## 📖 Usage

### Automatic Monitoring

The system **automatically monitors** all workflow runs. No action required!

When a failure is detected:
1. 🔍 **Analyzes** the failure type
2. 📊 **Generates** a detailed report
3. 🔧 **Applies** auto-fix (if enabled)
4. 📢 **Notifies** via GitHub summary

### Manual Health Check

Trigger a manual health check:

```bash
# Via GitHub UI:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Superhuman Action Monitor"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose mode: monitor / auto-fix / full-health-check

# Via CLI:
gh workflow run superhuman-action-monitor.yml \
  --field mode=full-health-check
```

### Local Health Check

```bash
# Run local health check
cd /path/to/my_ai_project
python scripts/check_action_health.py

# View report
less .github/health-reports/health-check-*.json
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Enable/Disable Auto-Fix

**Method 1: Workflow Dispatch**
```yaml
# When running manually, choose mode:
mode: auto-fix  # Enable auto-fix
mode: monitor   # Monitor only (no auto-fix)
```

**Method 2: Modify Workflow**
```yaml
# Edit .github/workflows/superhuman-action-monitor.yml
# Change auto-fix job condition:
if: needs.monitor-and-analyze.outputs.needs_fix == 'true' && true  # Always run
if: needs.monitor-and-analyze.outputs.needs_fix == 'true' && false # Never run
```

### Adjust Health Check Frequency

```yaml
# In superhuman-action-monitor.yml:
schedule:
  - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours (default)
  - cron: '0 */3 * * *'  # Every 3 hours (more frequent)
  - cron: '0 0 * * *'    # Once per day (less frequent)
```

### Customize Failure Detection

```yaml
# Add custom failure patterns in monitor-and-analyze job:
if [[ "$WORKFLOW_NAME" == *"MyCustomWorkflow"* ]]; then
  FAILURE_TYPE="custom_failure"
  NEEDS_FIX="true"
  echo "🔍 Detected: Custom failure type"
fi
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Auto-Fix Not Running

**Problem:** Auto-fix doesn't execute after failure detection.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if auto-fix is enabled
cat .github/workflows/superhuman-action-monitor.yml | grep "auto-fix"

# Enable auto-fix manually
gh workflow run superhuman-action-monitor.yml --field mode=auto-fix
```

#### 2. Health Check Failures

**Problem:** Health check script reports errors.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install missing dependencies
pip install black isort ruff pylint flake8 pyyaml

# Re-run health check
python scripts/check_action_health.py
```

#### 3. Workflow Not Triggering

**Problem:** Monitor doesn't trigger on workflow completion.

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Verify workflow names in superhuman-action-monitor.yml match actual workflows
workflows: ["Python Application CI", "🏆 Code Quality & Security (Superhuman)"]

# Check GitHub Actions permissions
permissions:
  contents: write
  actions: read
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```yaml
# Add to any job in superhuman-action-monitor.yml:
env:
  DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

### View Logs

```bash
# Via GitHub UI:
Actions → Superhuman Action Monitor → Latest run → View logs

# Via CLI:
gh run list --workflow=superhuman-action-monitor.yml
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

---

## 🎓 Advanced Features

### 1. Custom Auto-Fix Rules

Add custom auto-fix logic:

```yaml
# In auto-fix job, add:
- name: 🔧 Custom Auto-Fix
  run: |
    echo "Applying custom fixes..."
    
    # Example: Fix specific pattern
    find app/ -name "*.py" -exec sed -i 's/old_pattern/new_pattern/g' {} \;
    
    # Example: Run custom script
    python scripts/custom_fixer.py
```

### 2. Integration with External Services

```yaml
# Add notification to Slack, Discord, etc.
- name: 📢 Notify External Service
  if: failure()
  run: |
    curl -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"text":"🚨 GitHub Actions failure detected!"}'
```

### 3. Advanced Health Metrics

Create custom health metrics:

```python
# In scripts/check_action_health.py, add:
def check_custom_metrics(self):
    """Check custom project-specific metrics"""
    # Example: Check test coverage
    coverage_report = self.project_root / "coverage.xml"
    if coverage_report.exists():
        # Parse and analyze coverage
        pass
    
    # Example: Check documentation
    docs_updated = self.check_docs_freshness()
    
    # Example: Check dependencies
    outdated_deps = self.check_dependency_versions()
```

### 4. Predictive Analysis

Implement predictive failure detection:

```python
# Analyze failure trends
def predict_failures(self):
    """Predict potential failures based on historical data"""
    # Analyze past 30 days of workflow runs
    # Identify patterns leading to failures
    # Generate preventive recommendations
    pass
```

## 📊 Health Dashboard Interpretation

### Status Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning | Action Required |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| 🟢 ACTIVE | System healthy | None |
| 🟡 MONITORING | Watching for issues | None |
| 🟠 WARNING | Minor issues detected | Review recommended |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Major issues found | Immediate action |

### Quality Metrics

- **Black Compliance:** Should be 100%
- **Import Organization:** Should be 100%
- **Linting:** <10 warnings is acceptable
- **Test Coverage:** Monitor trend
- **Security:** Zero critical issues

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Regular Monitoring

```bash
# Check health weekly
python scripts/check_action_health.py

# Review reports monthly
ls -lh .github/health-reports/
```

### 2. Proactive Fixes

Don't wait for auto-fix - apply fixes proactively:

```bash
# Daily code quality check
black --check app/ tests/ && \
isort --check-only app/ tests/ && \
ruff check app/ tests/
```

### 3. Keep Tools Updated

```bash
# Update formatting tools regularly
pip install --upgrade black isort ruff pylint flake8
```

### 4. Review Auto-Fix Commits

Always review commits made by the auto-fix system:

```bash
git log --author="Superhuman Action Monitor"
```
