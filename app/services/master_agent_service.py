# PRIME DIRECTIVE:
#   This file serves as a temporary, structural placeholder for the Overmind service.
#   Its primary purpose is to resolve the `ImportError` in `admin/routes.py` and
#   allow the application and test suite to load successfully.
#
#   The logic within is minimal and will be replaced by the full Overmind
#   multi-layer architecture in subsequent development phases.
