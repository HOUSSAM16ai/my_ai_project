## 📌 Project Summary
The Youth AI Safety Toolkit provides a practical, open-source curriculum and digital tools designed to increase AI literacy and safety behaviors among adolescents (13-18) in the EMEA region.

## 🎯 Who This Is For
- **Youth-Serving Organizations:** NGOs, after-school clubs, and libraries.
- **Educators:** Teachers seeking ready-to-use AI safety lesson plans.
- **Parents:** Guardians looking for resources to discuss AI risks.
- **Policymakers:** Officials needing evidence on youth AI usage.
- **Product Teams:** Developers seeking youth-centric safety guidelines.

## 📦 What We Deliver
1.  **Digital Toolkit:** Interactive web modules on hallucinations, bias, and data privacy.
2.  **Educator Pack:** Lesson plans, slide decks, and facilitator guides.
3.  **Evidence Base:** Public reports on the efficacy of these interventions.
4.  **Policy Briefs:** Actionable recommendations for regional stakeholders.

## 🔬 Methods at a Glance
Our approach follows a rigorous "Design → Pilot → Measure → Iterate → Publish" cycle:
1.  **Design:** Co-creation with youth panels and ethics advisors.
2.  **Pilot:** Controlled testing in partner sites across [TODO: Countries].
3.  **Measure:** Pre/Post evaluation of safety behaviors (not just opinions).
4.  **Iterate:** Refine tools based on user feedback and failure analysis.
5.  **Publish:** Open access to all tools, data, and findings.

## 📊 Impact Measurement
We focus on **behavioral change** and **measurable skills**, not just reach.
- **Key Metric:** % increase in ability to identify AI hallucinations.
- **Key Metric:** % of participants demonstrating safe data practices in simulations.
- **See:** [`docs/IMPACT_MEASUREMENT_PLAN.md`](docs/IMPACT_MEASUREMENT_PLAN.md) for full details.

## 🛡️ Ethics & Safeguarding
Safety is our DNA. We adhere to strict safeguarding and ethical research principles.
- **Youth Protection:** Comprehensive [`SAFEGUARDING.md`](SAFEGUARDING.md) policy.
- **Data Privacy:** GDPR-compliant [`DATA_PROTECTION.md`](DATA_PROTECTION.md).
- **Ethical Review:** All content vetted via [`ETHICS_REVIEW.md`](ETHICS_REVIEW.md).

## 🕊️ Transparency & Independence
- **Open Science:** We publish negative results and null findings.
- **Independence:** Our research is independent of commercial influence.
- **Open Source:** All code and content are available under open licenses.
