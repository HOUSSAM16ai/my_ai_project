# North Africa AI Safety Lab (NAAS Lab) — Project: EL-NUKHBA

> **Grant Application: EMEA Youth & Wellbeing 2026 (Submitted)**

## Executive Summary
EL-NUKHBA (The Elite) equips North African youth with open-source tools to audit AI models for cultural bias and safety risks, generating independent evidence for safer regional AI deployment.

## Deliverables
1.  **The Toolkit**: A technical suite for youth-led AI safety audits (bias detection, safety probing).
2.  **The Evidence**: Verifiable, data-driven reports on AI safety gaps specific to the EMEA region.
3.  **Policy Briefs**: Actionable recommendations for regulators and educators based on youth findings.

## Methods
Our "Cycle of Safety" approach ensures rigorous, youth-centric evaluation:
1.  **Design**: Develop culturally relevant audit scenarios and safety curriculums.
2.  **Pilot**: Conduct controlled testing sessions with youth auditors under strict supervision.
3.  **Measure**: Quantify harms, success rates of safeguards, and literacy improvements.
4.  **Iterate**: Refine tools and protocols based on pilot feedback.
5.  **Publish**: Release open-access evidence and policy briefs to stakeholders.

## Impact Measurement
We track success through 8 core metrics (baselines established in Pilot Phase 1):
1.  **Youth Auditors Trained**: Number of participants completing safety evaluation training (Target: TODO).
2.  **Models Audited**: Number of unique AI models tested for safety risks (Target: TODO).
3.  **Vulnerabilities Identified**: Distinct safety flaws found and reported (Target: TODO).
4.  **Policy Briefs Published**: Number of technical reports released (Target: TODO).
5.  **Toolkit Adoption**: Number of partner NGOs using the toolkit (Target: TODO).
6.  **Literacy Improvement**: Percentage increase in pre/post-workshop scores (Target: TODO%).
7.  **Harm Reduction**: Decrease in exposure to harmful content in controlled tests (Target: TODO%).
8.  **Stakeholder Engagement**: Number of meetings with policymakers or product teams (Target: TODO).

## Safeguarding & Data Protection
We operate under strict ethical guidelines to protect our youth participants.
-   **Safeguarding**: See [`SAFEGUARDING.md`](SAFEGUARDING.md) for our Two-Adult Rule, risk assessments, and incident response protocols.
-   **Data Protection**: See [`DATA_PROTECTION.md`](DATA_PROTECTION.md) for our privacy-by-design approach and GDPR-aligned practices.

## Independence & Transparency
NAAS Lab is an independent research initiative. We are not funded by AI product companies for this specific audit work, ensuring unbiased evaluation. All tools, methodologies, and findings are published open-source to foster trust and reproducibility.

    ```
2.  **Review Protocols**:
    Read [`SAFEGUARDING.md`](SAFEGUARDING.md) and [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before running any sessions.
3.  **Setup Environment**:
    (See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed instructions)
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Install dependencies (refer to specific setup guides in docs/)
    ```
