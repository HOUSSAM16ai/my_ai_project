# Getting Started with the Youth AI Safety Toolkit

Welcome to the technical core of the EL-NUKHBA project. This toolkit is designed to be run by youth auditors under the supervision of trained facilitators.

## Prerequisites

-   **Hardware**: Laptop or Tablet with a modern web browser.
-   **Software**: Docker (for local deployment) or access to the hosted web app.
-   **Knowledge**: Basic understanding of Generative AI (LLMs).

## Modules

1.  **Bias Detection**: Prompts designed to reveal cultural or gender stereotypes.
2.  **Safety Probing**: "Red Teaming" scenarios to test refusal mechanisms.
3.  **Literacy Quiz**: Pre/Post assessment module.

## Running a Session

1.  **Login**: Use the anonymized User ID provided by your facilitator (e.g., `User-001`).
2.  **Select a Mission**: Choose a predefined audit scenario.
3.  **Log Findings**: Use the "Flag" button to report any unsafe or biased output.
