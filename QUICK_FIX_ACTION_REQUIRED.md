# 🎯 Quick Reference: No More "Action Required" in GitHub Actions

## 🚨 Problem → ✅ Solution

| Problem | Solution | Code |
|---------|----------|------|
| Self-monitoring loop | Skip if monitoring self | `if [ "$WORKFLOW_NAME" = "This Workflow" ]; then exit 0; fi` |
| `if: always()` ambiguous | Verify job status | `if [ "${{ needs.job.result }}" = "failure" ]; then exit 1; fi` |
| No explicit exit | Add exit 0 or exit 1 | `exit 0` |
| Optional job fails | Warn, don't fail | `echo "⚠️ Warning"; # continue` |
| Cancellation causes error | Exit gracefully | `if [ "$RESULT" = "cancelled" ]; then exit 0; fi` |

---

## 📋 Essential Patterns

### 1. Prevent Self-Monitoring

```yaml
- name: Analyze
  run: |
    WORKFLOW_NAME="${{ github.event.workflow_run.name }}"
    
    if [ "$WORKFLOW_NAME" = "🚀 Superhuman Action Monitor" ]; then
      echo "⚠️ Skipping self-monitoring"
      exit 0
    fi
```

### 2. Verify Job Status (if: always())

```yaml
- name: ✅ Verify Success
  run: |
    JOB_RESULT="${{ needs.job-name.result }}"
    
    if [ "$JOB_RESULT" = "failure" ]; then
      exit 1
    fi
    
    if [ "$JOB_RESULT" = "cancelled" ]; then
      exit 0
    fi
    
    exit 0
```

### 3. Critical vs Optional Jobs

```yaml
# Critical (must succeed)
if [ "$BUILD_RESULT" = "failure" ]; then
  FAILED=true
fi

# Optional (warn only)
if [ "$AI_RESULT" = "failure" ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Warning (non-critical)"
fi
```

### 4. Explicit Exit Codes

```yaml
if pytest; then
  echo "✅ Success"
  exit 0
else
  echo "❌ Failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

---

## 🔍 Job Result Values

```yaml
${{ needs.job.result }} can be:
├─ success   → Job completed successfully
├─ failure   → Job failed
├─ skipped   → Job was skipped
└─ cancelled → Workflow was cancelled
```

---

## ✅ Checklist for Every Workflow

```
□ All steps have explicit exit codes (exit 0 or exit 1)
□ Jobs with if: always() verify dependent job status
□ Critical jobs identified and checked
□ Optional jobs warn but don't fail workflow
□ Cancellations handled gracefully (exit 0)
□ Self-monitoring prevented (if applicable)
□ Clear logging with visual separators
□ Status indicators (✅ ❌ ⚠️) used
```

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Add Explicit Exit to Step
```yaml
# Before
- run: echo "Done"

# After
- run: |
    echo "Done"
    exit 0
```

### Fix 2: Verify Status in if: always()
```yaml
# Before
notify:
  if: always()
  steps:
    - run: echo "Notify"

# After
notify:
  if: always()
  steps:
    - run: |
        if [ "${{ needs.job.result }}" = "failure" ]; then
          exit 1
        fi
        exit 0
```

### Fix 3: Skip Self-Monitoring
```yaml
# Add to workflow that monitors others
if [ "${{ github.event.workflow_run.name }}" = "This Workflow" ]; then
  exit 0
fi
```

## 🚀 Result

**Before:**
```
🔴 Action required
