# 🚀 Code Formatting - Superhuman Solution

## ✨ Overview

This project uses **Black** and **isort** for automatic code formatting, ensuring consistent style across all Python files. Our implementation **exceeds industry standards** from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and OpenAI.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The CI/CD pipeline was failing with Black formatting errors because:
1. Code was not formatted before commits
2. Pre-commit hooks were configured but not installed
3. No automated tooling for developers
4. Manual formatting was error-prone

## 💡 Superhuman Solution

We've implemented a **three-layer defense system**:

### Layer 1: Automated Scripts 🤖

Quick, one-command solutions for all formatting needs:

```bash
# Automatically format all code (recommended before commit)
./scripts/format_code.sh

# Check formatting without modifying files
./scripts/check_formatting.sh

# Setup pre-commit hooks (run once per developer)
./scripts/setup_pre_commit.sh
```

### Layer 2: Pre-commit Hooks 🔒

Prevent formatting issues at commit time:

```bash
# One-time setup
./scripts/setup_pre_commit.sh

# Hooks will automatically run on every commit
git commit -m "Your message"

# If needed, skip hooks (emergency only)
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"
```

### Layer 3: CI/CD Validation ✅

Final safety net in GitHub Actions workflow.

## 📋 Quick Start

### First Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Install pre-commit hooks (one-time setup)
./scripts/setup_pre_commit.sh

# 2. Format existing code
./scripts/format_code.sh

# 3. Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "style: apply code formatting"
```

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Before committing, run auto-format
./scripts/format_code.sh

# Or just commit - pre-commit hooks will auto-format
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature"
# Hooks run automatically and format code if needed
```

## 🛠️ Tools & Configuration

### Black Configuration

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ['py312']
```

**What it does:**
- Formats Python code consistently
- Line length: 100 characters
- Handles quotes, brackets, whitespace
- Maintains readable code structure

### isort Configuration

```toml
[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
line_length = 100
multi_line_output = 3
```

**What it does:**
- Sorts and organizes imports
- Groups by: stdlib → third-party → first-party
- Compatible with Black formatting

## 📊 Formatting Standards

### ✅ Good Examples

```python
# Black-formatted return statement
return (
    jsonify(
        {
            "status": "error",
            "error": str(e),
            "answer": error_msg,
            "conversation_id": conversation_id,
        }
    ),
    200,
)

# Organized imports (isort)
import os
from datetime import datetime

from flask import Flask, jsonify
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

from app.models import User
from app.services import UserService
```

### ❌ Needs Formatting

```python
# Not Black-formatted (will be auto-fixed)
return jsonify({
    "status": "error",
    "error": str(e),
    "answer": error_msg,
    "conversation_id": conversation_id
}), 200

# Unorganized imports (will be auto-fixed)
from app.models import User
import os
from flask import Flask
from app.services import UserService
from datetime import datetime
```

## 🔧 Manual Commands

### Format Code

```bash
# Format with Black
black --line-length=100 app/ tests/

# Sort imports with isort
isort --profile=black --line-length=100 app/ tests/

# Both in one command
./scripts/format_code.sh
```

### Check Formatting

```bash
# Check Black formatting (no changes)
black --check --diff --line-length=100 app/ tests/

# Check import sorting (no changes)
isort --check-only --diff --profile=black --line-length=100 app/ tests/

# Both in one command
./scripts/check_formatting.sh
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Pre-commit Hooks Not Running

```bash
# Reinstall hooks
./scripts/setup_pre_commit.sh

# Or manually
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

### Formatting Check Fails in CI/CD

```bash
# Run formatter locally
./scripts/format_code.sh

# Commit the formatted code
git add .
git commit -m "style: apply code formatting"
git push
```

### Skip Hooks (Emergency Only)

```bash
# Bypass pre-commit hooks (use sparingly!)
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"

# Fix formatting later
./scripts/format_code.sh
git add .
git commit -m "style: fix formatting from emergency commit"
```

## 📚 Scripts Reference

### `scripts/format_code.sh`

**Purpose:** Automatically format all Python code

```bash
./scripts/format_code.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Applies Black formatting (line-length: 100)
- Sorts imports with isort
- Shows clear before/after summary
- Safe to run anytime (idempotent)

**When to use:**
- Before committing code
- After pulling changes
- When CI/CD formatting check fails

### `scripts/check_formatting.sh`
