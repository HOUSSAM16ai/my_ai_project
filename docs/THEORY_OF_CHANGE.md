# Theory of Change

**Purpose:** To articulate the logical flow from the problem we are solving to the long-term impact we aim to achieve.

## Logic Model

### 1. The Problem
Youth in the EMEA region lack accessible, evidence-based tools to navigate AI safety risks (misinformation, bias, privacy) and leverage AI for wellbeing. Educators and policymakers lack data on effective interventions.

### 2. Inputs (Resources)
- **Funding:** OpenAI Grant.
- **Team:** Researchers, developers, educators, youth advisors.
- **Partners:** Schools, youth NGOs, academic reviewers.
- **Tech:** Open-source AI models, hosting infrastructure.

### 3. Activities
- **Develop:** Co-design the "Youth AI Safety Toolkit" (interactive modules, guides).
- **Pilot:** Deploy in [TODO: Number] partner sites across [TODO: Number] countries.
- **Evaluate:** Pre/post testing of AI literacy and safety behaviors.
- **Disseminate:** Publish open-access findings and toolkits.

### 4. Outputs (Deliverables)
- 1 x Open Source Codebase (GitHub).
- [TODO: Number] x Educational Modules (Web/Mobile).
- 1 x Educator Training Pack.
- 1 x Evaluation Report.

### 5. Outcomes (Short/Medium Term)
- **Youth:** Increased ability to identify AI hallucinations and bias.
- **Youth:** Improved confidence in using AI tools safely.
- **Educators:** Increased capacity to teach AI safety.
- **Policy:** Evidence-based recommendations adopted by partners.

### 6. Long-Term Impact
- A generation of EMEA youth who are critical, safe, and empowered AI users.
- A standardized, proven framework for AI safety education available globally.

## Measurable Indicators

| Indicator Level | Metric | Data Source | Target (Example) |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Output** | # of youth reaching pilot completion | System Logs | 500+ |
| **Outcome** | % increase in "AI Risk Identification" score | Pre/Post Survey | +30% |
| **Outcome** | % of participants reporting higher confidence | Post-Survey | 75% |
| **Outcome** | Net Promoter Score (NPS) from Educators | Feedback Form | > 50 |
| **Impact** | # of external orgs adopting the toolkit | Download Stats | 10+ |

**Assumptions:**
- Schools/NGOs are willing to allocate time for AI safety education.
- The toolkit is culturally relevant across chosen EMEA regions.
