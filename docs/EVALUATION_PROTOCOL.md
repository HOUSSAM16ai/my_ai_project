# Evaluation Protocol

**Purpose:** A lightweight, rigorous framework to evaluate the efficacy of the Youth AI Safety Toolkit.

## 1. Research Questions

1.  **RQ1 (Efficacy):** Does the toolkit significantly improve youth participants' ability to identify AI safety risks (hallucinations, bias)?
2.  **RQ2 (Confidence):** Does the toolkit increase participants' self-efficacy in navigating AI-driven environments?
3.  **RQ3 (Usability):** Is the toolkit engaging and accessible for the target demographic (13-18)?

## 2. Study Design

We will employ a **Quasi-Experimental Pre-Test/Post-Test Design**.

-   **Group A (Treatment):** Youth using the toolkit.
-   **Group B (Control - Optional):** Youth receiving standard digital literacy instruction (if resources allow).

**Timeline:**
-   **T0 (Pre-Test):** Baseline assessment.
-   **Intervention:** 2-4 weeks of toolkit usage.
-   **T1 (Post-Test):** Assessment immediately after completion.
-   **T2 (Follow-up - Optional):** 3 months later to test retention.

## 3. Sampling Approach

-   **Target Sample Size:** N = [TODO: e.g., 200] participants.
-   **Recruitment:** Through partner schools and youth organizations in [TODO: Regions].
-   **Inclusion Criteria:** Age 13-18, consent/assent provided.

## 4. Instruments

| Instrument | Type | Purpose | Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Literacy Quiz** | Knowledge | Measures technical understanding. | Adapted from [TODO: Cite source if any] |
| **Risk Scenarios** | Performance | Measures practical safety skills. | Developed in-house. |
| **UEQ-S (Short)** | User Experience | Measures usability and engagement. | Standard UEQ. |

## 5. Analysis Plan

-   **Quantitative:**
    -   Paired t-tests for Pre/Post score comparison within groups.
    -   ANOVA if comparing multiple groups/demographics.
-   **Qualitative:**
    -   Thematic coding of open-ended feedback questions.

## 6. Limitations & Mitigation

| Limitation | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hawthorne Effect** | Emphasize "testing the tool, not the user" to reduce performance anxiety. |
| **Digital Divide** | Ensure toolkit works on low-bandwidth/mobile devices. |
| **Short-term measure** | Acknowledge T1 limitations; propose T2 follow-up for future grants. |

## 7. Reporting

Findings will be published in:
1.  **Internal Evaluation Report** for stakeholders.
2.  **Public White Paper** (anonymized).
3.  **Academic Conference/Journal** (if results warrant).
