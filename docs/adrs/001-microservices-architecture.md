# ADR 001: Microservices Architecture for AI Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to build a world-class AI platform that can scale to handle millions of requests, support multiple AI models, provide enterprise-grade security, and surpass the capabilities of tech giants like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, Apple, and Amazon.

## Decision
We will implement a microservices architecture with the following key characteristics:

### 1. Service Decomposition
- **AI Router Service**: Intelligent model selection and routing
- **Embeddings Service**: Vector generation and caching
- **Guardrails Service**: Content safety and compliance
- **Prompt Service**: Template management and versioning
- **Retriever Service**: RAG and vector search
- **User/Billing/Audit Services**: Supporting services

### 2. Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous**: gRPC for inter-service, HTTP/REST for external APIs
- **Asynchronous**: Kafka for events, NATS for pub/sub
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for mTLS, traffic management, observability

### 3. Data Management
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **Event Sourcing**: For audit and state reconstruction
- **CDC (Debezium)**: For data synchronization
- **Vector Database**: Dedicated for embeddings (Pinecone/Weaviate/Milvus)

### 4. AI/ML Layer
- **Model Serving**: KServe with vLLM/TGI for LLM inference
- **GPU Management**: NVIDIA MIG for multi-tenancy
- **Model Routing**: A/B testing, canary deployments, multi-armed bandit
- **Caching**: Multi-layer (prompt, embedding, response)

### 5. Observability
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry â†’ Jaeger/Tempo
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logs**: Loki with structured logging
- **SLO/SLI**: Error budgets and proactive alerting

### 6. Security
- **Zero Trust**: mTLS everywhere via Istio
- **Authentication**: OIDC/OAuth2 with Keycloak
- **Authorization**: OPA for policy enforcement
- **Secrets**: HashiCorp Vault with auto-rotation
- **Supply Chain**: SBOM, Cosign signing, SLSA compliance

### 7. CI/CD
- **GitOps**: Argo CD for declarative deployments
- **Progressive Delivery**: Argo Rollouts (canary, blue-green)
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, contract (Pact), chaos
- **Security Scanning**: Multi-layer (SAST, DAST, SCA, container)

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Each service scales independently
- **Resilience**: Failure isolation prevents cascading failures
- **Flexibility**: Easy to adopt new technologies per service
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently on services
- **Observability**: Fine-grained monitoring and debugging
- **Security**: Defense in depth with multiple layers

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More moving parts to manage
- **Operational Overhead**: Requires sophisticated tooling
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency challenges
- **Testing**: Integration testing more complex
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Service Mesh**: Handles service discovery, load balancing, retries
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Distributed Tracing**: Debug cross-service issues
- **Contract Testing**: Catch breaking changes early
- **Chaos Engineering**: Test resilience proactively

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Architecture
**Rejected**: Doesn't scale well for large teams, difficult to maintain, single point of failure

### 2. Serverless (FaaS)
**Rejected**: Cold start issues for AI workloads, vendor lock-in, limited GPU support

### 3. Modular Monolith
**Considered**: Good middle ground but doesn't provide deployment independence we need
