# Impact Measurement Plan

## 1. Beneficiary Definitions

| Type | Definition | Measurement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Beneficiaries** | Youth (13-18) who participate in safety audit workshops. | Number of participants completing the training module. |
| **Indirect Beneficiaries** | Users of AI products improved by our findings. | Estimated user base of audited models (cautious estimate). |
| **Partner Organizations** | NGOs/Schools adopting the toolkit. | Number of verified downloads/installations + active pilots. |

## 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

*Baselines to be established in Pilot Phase 1.*

1.  **Youth Auditors Trained**: Number of participants completing safety evaluation training (Target: TODO).
2.  **Models Audited**: Number of unique AI models tested for safety risks (Target: TODO).
3.  **Vulnerabilities Identified**: Distinct safety flaws found and reported (Target: TODO).
4.  **Policy Briefs Published**: Number of technical reports released (Target: TODO).
5.  **Toolkit Adoption**: Number of partner NGOs using the toolkit (Target: TODO).
6.  **Literacy Improvement**: Percentage increase in pre/post-workshop scores (Target: TODO%).
7.  **Harm Reduction**: Decrease in exposure to harmful content in controlled tests (Target: TODO%).
8.  **Stakeholder Engagement**: Number of meetings with policymakers or product teams (Target: TODO).

## 3. Measurement Instruments

1.  **Pre/Post Survey**: Assesses knowledge of AI mechanisms, privacy risks, and critical thinking (10 questions).
2.  **Scenario Tasks**: Practical test where youth identify flaws in AI outputs (Pass/Fail).
3.  **Incident Logs**: Count of harmful outputs successfully flagged during "Red Teaming" exercises.
4.  **Partner Feedback Form**: NGO staff rating on toolkit usability and relevance (1-5 scale).

## 4. Data Collection Schedule

-   **T-0 (Registration)**: Baseline demographic data (anonymized) + Pre-survey.
-   **T+1 (Workshop)**: Real-time logging of audit findings (automated by toolkit).
-   **T+2 (Post-Workshop)**: Post-survey + Debrief feedback.
-   **T+30 Days**: Follow-up survey (retention of knowledge).

## 5. Validity Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Self-Report Bias** | Triangulate survey data with practical scenario task scores. |
| **Sample Selection** | Ensure diverse recruitment across socio-economic backgrounds (not just tech-savvy youth). |
| **Short-Term Focus** | Include 30-day follow-up to measure lasting impact. |
