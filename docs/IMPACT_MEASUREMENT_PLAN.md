# Impact Measurement Plan

**Purpose:** To define how we will rigorously measure the success and impact of the project, moving beyond "vanity metrics" to evidence of change.

## 1. Direct Beneficiaries
- **Primary:** Youth aged 13-18 in the EMEA region.
- **Secondary:** Educators, youth workers, parents.

**Reach Counting Rules:**
- **Active User:** Someone who completes at least one full module.
- **Passive Reach:** Website visitors or downloaders (tracked separately).

## 2. Key Metrics & Instruments

| Metric ID | Name | Definition | Instrument | Collection Schedule |
|-----------|------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| **M1** | **AI Literacy Score** | Composite score of technical understanding (0-100). | Knowledge Quiz | Pre-Start / Post-Completion |
| **M2** | **Safety Behavior** | Ability to identify unsafe AI outputs (Phishing/Deepfakes). | Scenario Simulation | In-App (During use) |
| **M3** | **Wellbeing Impact** | Self-reported anxiety/optimism regarding AI. | Wellbeing Scale (Short) | Pre / Post |
| **M4** | **Educator Efficacy** | Teacher confidence in delivering AI topics. | Educator Survey | Post-Training |

## 3. Baselines & Targets

| Metric | Baseline (Estimated) | Target (End of Grant) | Rationale |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| M1 (Literacy) | 40% (Low) | 70% | Based on pilot data. |
| M2 (Safety) | 30% detection rate | 80% detection rate | Primary goal of toolkit. |
| Reach | 0 | [TODO: Insert Target] | Grant capacity. |

## 4. Analysis Approach
- **Quantitative:** Paired t-tests to measure significant changes between Pre and Post scores.
- **Qualitative:** Thematic analysis of open-text feedback from youth and educators.
- **Disaggregation:** Data will be analyzed by age group and gender to check for equity.

## 5. Risks to Validity & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Self-Selection Bias** | Acknowledge in reporting; attempt random sampling within partner sites. |
| **Drop-out Rates** | Keep modules short and engaging; gamify progress. |
| **Social Desirability** | Use scenario-based testing (behavior) rather than just self-report opinions. |
